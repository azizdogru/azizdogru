- 👋 Hi, I’m Aziz Dogru.
- 👀 I’m interested in Cloud Systems and DevOps Engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving myself on DevOps.
- 💞️ I'm looking for a great, enthusiastic engineering team to work for that will provide me with challenging,
     interesting work that I can learn from and contribute to. I'd like to contribute more to the health and educational space but that is not a must.
- 📫 You can reach me at the link below.
